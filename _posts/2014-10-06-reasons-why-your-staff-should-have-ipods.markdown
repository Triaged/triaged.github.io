Lately, I’ve been talking to a number of hotels about how they manage operations. Many upscale, boutique hotels have already put devices in their frontline staff’s hands. However, other hotels wonder if the investment is really worthwhile. They manage with walkie talkies or with pen and paper now. Is there enough benefit to outweigh the cost of purchasing the devices and training employees.

Here are eleven reasons why you should invest in iPod Touches for your hotel staff:

## 1. Speed 

Guests don’t like issues at a hotel (duh!), but they *hate* when issues aren’t resolved promptly and professionally. That’s the #1 reason they stop staying at a hotel. When your staff has iPod Touches, you minimize the time and effort to get a guest issue to the right person to fix it.

## 2. Accountability

Dispatching a guest issue is only half the battle. You need your employees to receive the message, take responsibility, and fix it. With an iPod Touch, you can send them tasks via push notification, plus ask for visual evidence when the task is done!

## 3. Engagement

Everyone likes the feeling of seeing a to-do list shrink. By putting tasks into an iPod Touch, you allow staff to see their workload and get the positive reinforcement from knocking off items. Plus, they can see their completion times - and they know everyone else can, too.

## 4. Empowerment

Your managers have smartphones. Your guests have smartphones. When they encounter an issue, they solve it on the spot using the computer in their pocket. Shouldn’t your staff be on a level playing field?

## 5. Retention

News flash: people really like Apple products. When your staff spends all day interacting with hardware, won’t they be happier if it’s good hardware? Plus, they expect and understand the user experience from their personal lives.

## 6. Clean

No paper forms. No walkie talkie chatter. No big belt clips.

## 7. Brand 

Your brand amounts to every detail in every hotel under your flag. When staff have iPod touches, it sends the message that your hotel has state-of-the-art technology and takes its operations seriously. Those are good messages to send, especially when you can back them up.

## 8. Improvement

If you can measure it, you can’t manage it. If all your operations flow through technology, then you can measure anything with the right software. iPods are the first step towards gaining the power to manage anything in your hotel.

## 9. Cheap

Straight on the Apple website, you can buy a [4th generation iPod touch for $109](http://store.apple.com/us/product/FE178LL/A/refurbished-ipod-touch-16gb-black), or less than $5 per month, amortized over two years. Quick — can you name 3 better things to invest in at $5 per month?

## 10. Easy

You don’t need to train someone to use an iPod. [Children under 2 can use Apple products](http://nyti.ms/1phsmEP), and they’re used in every country.

## 11. The Future

Sure, there’s an investment to equip frontline staff with new technology, and it’s significant. But you get a platform that will take your hotel forward. You get to participate in technology advances - for streamlining operations, for surprise-and-delighting guests, for creating community under your brand.
