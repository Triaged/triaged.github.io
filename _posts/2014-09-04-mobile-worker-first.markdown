The Ritz Carlton encourages its maids to spend up to $2,000 to improve a guest's experience.  In the same [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2013/04/17/ibm-ritz-carlton-and-yum-brands-empower-front-line-employees-do-you/), David Novak, CEO of Yum! Brands (think KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell), talks about corporate as “one big restaurant support center”.

Frontline employees are finally getting some love, and rightfully so!  After all, frontline staff make or break your customer's experience.  We accept this as common wisdom today, but it represents a big shift from the command and control management philosophy.  While the prevailing mindset has begun to shift, management practice and software have yet to evolve - and that's what's needed to truly empower frontline employees.

## Management practice
The old way of thinking went something like this.  You make your smartest people corporate managers, and these “knowledge workers” figure out the best way to do things.  They sit at headquarters, wear business casual to work, and don't go anywhere near the customer.  Once they figure out the best way to do things, they write operational manuals in great detail, so the frontline staff doesn't need to waste time thinking - they can just execute their rote tasks efficiently!

It's easy to see the folly of this thinking, but how much have operations changed in practice?  The airline's gate agent still cites corporate policy when he tells me that I cannot switch to the earlier flight, which has empty seats, without paying a $150 change fee.

We see a few reasons that empowering frontline employees is harder in practice than in theory:

###

* **It sounds costly.**  The easier we make it to accommodate customer requests, the more we'll end up accommodating, and that leads to extra costs.  That's correct, but painfully simplistic.  Sure, spending extra money on your customers can be wasteful and cut into profits.  But it can also be a smart investment that greatly improves a customer's experience, makes her much more likely to repeat purchase, and prompts her to refer more customers.  Your frontline staff is best positioned to know the difference.

###

* **So what's my new job?**  The decision to empower frontline employees needs to be made, ironically, at corporate.  And it will mean corporate managers go from doing things that sound important and glamorous - optimizing the customer experience! defining operational processes! - to doing one thing that sounds low level: supporting frontline staff.  Further, the corporate manager must admit that the frontline employee, whose resume may be less impressive, is better positioned to make important customer decisions.

###

* **How will it even work?**  Frontline staff often aren't on corporate email.  They often don't have company-provided smartphones (and some may not have personal smartphones).  Because they're serving customers, they're rarely at a computer.  Even if you want to empower frontline staff, how do you enable it?

##Software tools
Most software has been built with the old management paradigm in mind.  It's built for knowledge workers, who sit at a desk most of the day.  Sure, modern software companies have created mobile versions to make their tools “cross-platform”, but we'd argue that's different from designing software to meet the needs of a different worker altogether.

Quick - what's the mobile worker's equivalent to Microsoft Outlook?  What's the mobile worker's task management platform?  Feedback tool?  Training delivery tool?

We've struggled to answer these questions.  As we've spoken with frontline workers and their managers in several industries, they're largely working without modern software to support them.

###

* In construction, general contractors send instructions to subcontractors via text message, and then double back to document all communications in case an issue or dispute arises.

###

* In hospitality, the front desk prints a list of arrivals each day, and the team discusses special issues/treatment.  Important notes for the next shift are written down in a log book.

###

* In retail, when a problem arises, you wait for a break in the chatter on the walkie talkie to raise the issue. If the person you're looking for doesn't have a walkie, the nearest person runs over to alert them to the issue.

These folks are smart, resourceful, and they get the job done.  But, with a better set of tools, designed for the mobile worker first, how much more could they achieve?
