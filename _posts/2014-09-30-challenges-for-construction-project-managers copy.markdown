Being a project manager at a construction firm is an amazing and rewarding job. It’s a position where you make tangible contributions to you company and society. But it also comes with it’s own set of unique headaches. We’ve put a collection together of the 5 biggest challenges you’ll face as construction project managers below.

### You're [herding cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk7yqlTMvp8) for most of the day


Theoretically, it shouldn’t be that hard to execute a project on time and on budget. You start by defining your clients goals and creating a strategic plan that is reasonable. You figure out your procurement process, and assign tasks to the appropriate parties. Everything should run smoothly as long as everyone completes their assigned work… Unfortunately this is not how things work. Because you're responsible for such a large group of people (superintendents, safety inspectors, subcontractors, laborers, etc...) you inevitably run into quality issues, delays, staff shortages, safety issues, messes. Your team is great, but the list of issues they create is endless. If it feels like most of your day is dedicated to putting out fires, that’s probably because it is. 

### You're the job site ghost

As a construction project manager you are responsible for massively large and complex construction projects, but the time you spend on-site is very short. If your projects are close to the office, you’ll maybe be able to stop by once or twice a week max, but in many cases they are out of state or country, in which case you may never visit them. But it’s your job to make sure the project is moving forward, so you find ways to stay in touch and keep up to date on the projects progress, even if you’re not there in person.

### You feel like you're in an echo chamber all day

Because you can’t be on site all the time, you rely heavily on email, phone calls and text messaging, switching from tool to tool. You are constantly emailing important messages to supers and subs (who don’t respond for days). For the really important issues you’ll probably call them, and follow that up with an email because you know how easily people forget things on a phone conversation. You use text messages for smaller issues, or if you need a response immediately. And there's a good chance you’ll follow your text up with an email, just be be safe. Basically, your job is to communicate non-stop, all day long, every day. 

### You're constantly playing a game of “[telephone](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ab2e8HVM5TU/TGH5Ww8T1UI/AAAAAAAADKM/PSGITrDJyNc/s1600/Recession-to-Depression.jpg)”


It’s the start of a new day. You need to check the quality of the 3rd floor control joints because the last couple pours haven’t gone well. It seems like it should be a clear cut request. You send an email to your super, but he’s busy so he forwards the task to his assistant superintendent, who then asks the concrete foreman to check it out, and the concrete foreman asks his buddy Al to take a look. By the time you get a reply at the end of the day, your request and the answer you receive has taken on a strange life of its own. In order to be a great construction project manager you have to become an expert of the game of telephone - interpreting pieces of information that are forwarded through multiple networks of people.  

### You should get an creativity award for the workflows you come up with

The construction and capital project management software your construction firm uses to can be very powerful, but it comes with it’s own set headaches. Most solutions on the market move at the speed of a very slow animal, like a sloth and are both complex and unattractive. Additionally, most of the legacy software was designed for people sitting at desks, and have mobile apps that are lacking, meaning your subs and supers are not using them. Because of this you’re forced to create unique workflows that allows you to bridge the gap between your enterprise software system and your onsite team.
