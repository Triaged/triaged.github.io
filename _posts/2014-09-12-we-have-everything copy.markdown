At Badge, we've spent a lot of time trying to learn why it's so hard to empower frontline staff.  Today, I heard the challenge summed up well.

I was speaking with an executive who oversees retail operations for a Fortune 500 company.  We talked about how his company manages store operations, and he described the company's daily store operations in great detail, including the systems corporate uses to stay in sync with the store manager. He had a great handle on the process, and I was struggling to come up with follow up questions.

They have everything, I thought.

At a loss, I asked: “Well, do you feel there are any parts of the process that don't work well?”

The executive answered, “I wish we could get our frontline employees more engaged in the business.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well,” he said, “we have all these processes and systems, but they stop at the store manager.  When you visit a store, you don't interact with the manager, you interact with the cashier, or the person in the aisle.  That's the person that impacts your experience the most, and that's the person we struggle most to communicate with.”

In other words, they have everything, except the most important thing.

There are some good reasons why this is a hard problem, that many large, operationally strong companies struggle with.

### Finding Just Right
When it comes to giving frontline employees the right amount of information, companies face the Goldilocks scenario. 

###

* Give them too little, and they won't understand the company's new initiatives, which means those initiatives may fall flat.  

###

* Give them too much, and you risk overwhelming them.  If they're going to get their job done, they don't have time to sift through corporate communications to find the important stuff.  They'll likely absorb nothing, and too much becomes the same as too little.

What's the right amount?  You might argue they should understand the company's mission or brand story, how major initiatives connect to that mission, and how the initiatives will affect their job, if at all.  But every corporation has hundreds of initiatives.  What qualifies as major?  Do most corporations really have such a clear understanding of how initiatives impacts each individual?

### Hardware
We all know [Apple Stores are amazing](http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/19/13th-anniversary-of-first-apple-store-risky-gamble-to-most-profitable-retail-space-in-the-world/), and Apple Store associates use iPads to serve customers. It's old news.  But most companies are still trying to figure out how to apply this lesson to their particular context.

###

* Does the investment make sense in an environment with high volume, low profit units?

###

* Should devices replace walkie talkies?  Do they need to act as walkie talkies?

###

* What additional hardware functionality do they need?  Scanners?  POS?

Close competitors in the same industry don't always arrive at the same solution.  Home Depot went with [Motorolla devices that function more as inventory scanners](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/06/21/home-depot-rolls-out-new-mobile-devices-for-workers/); Lowe's went with [iPhones that serve more as a CRM + POS solution](http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/lowe%E2%80%99s-personalizes-mobile-shopping-via-in-store-app-features).

### Making It Actually Stick
Unfortunately, spending money to engage your employees doesn't mean you'll succeed in engaging your employees. The program needs to be good. What does that mean?

[A survey on digital engagement programs](http://technologyadvice.com/gamification/blog/survey-office-based-employees-want-digital-engagement-programs/) suggests employees might want things like visualization of progress, game elements, points, and social connections.  

In simpler terms, employees want to feel efficient, effective, and like their good work brings benefit to themselves and the company.  Then, to make an engagement program stick, you need to translate company goals to the units of an employee's work, train the individual to do the work, accurately measure the units of work completed, and reward or correct the outcome.

That's a hard problem.  Hardware and software can help, but leadership is the key to solving it.
