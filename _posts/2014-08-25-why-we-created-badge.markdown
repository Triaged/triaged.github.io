At Badge, we believe great companies are built by empowered employees, and we've made it our mission to support your team.

Ben Horowitz wrote a great blog post about [building good companies](http://www.bhorowitz.com/a_good_place_to_work%EF%BB%BF).  He defines a good place to work as one where “every person can wake up knowing that the work they do will be efficient, effective and make a difference both for the organization and themselves.”  That's a pretty good definition for an empowered employee.  

Work has changed (and will continue to change) in lots of meaningful ways.  Here are a few that we find significant.  We've also included some bold 10 year predictions.  Disagree?  Let us know - we're @badgeapp on Twitter.

**Jobs are becoming more flexible.** Will we see Carlos Slim's three day workweek anytime soon?  I don't know, but the forty-hour week, made standard in 1938, is on its way out.  43% of employers offer flexible working hours already, and millennials see it as a priority in jobs they choose.

* Bold prediction:  In 10 years, most employees will only come to the office three days or less per week.  Offices will serve as a place to convene - and they'll have more meeting rooms than desks.

**Work occurs everywhere.** 65% of email is opened first on mobile.  That's not surprising given that people are working at coffee shops, during their commute, at home, and everywhere in between. Further, we're seeing the rise of fully-mobile workforces.  At rental car agencies, you now return the car and get your receipt without going near a computer.

* Bold prediction:  In 10 years, you won't see a single computer in hotels, restaurants, or airports - made possibly by a new class of software built for mobile-only workers.

**Faces are changing more often.** Both companies and millennials are placing a premium on flexibility. The freelance economy is growing:  60% of companies plan to use more freelancers in 2014.  Further, 45% of millennials choose flexibility over pay, one driver that will lead over 60% of millennials to leave their current company within 3 years.

* Bold prediction:  In 10 years, half of a company's workforce will be freelancers, part time, or remote workers.

**We're getting closer to meritocracy.** People care what you can do for them, and it's getting easier than ever to figure that out.  During hiring, employers can visit a personal website, find a common reference on LinkedIn, or scan Twitter.  On the job, your boss gets some digital record of what accomplished, either in a task management system, email, or somewhere else.  More and more, you're judged on the value you create.

* Bold prediction:  In 10 years, you'll be able to find the best people for any role-industry combination online (e.g., product marketing for CPG), and it will be accurate.  The top performer will be compensated more than 5x the average performer.            
   
###

* We already see this in sports: Kevin Durant, the top-rated small forward in the NBA, makes $17.1M per year.  Tobias Harris, who's #25 out of 50, makes $1.4M per year.  And the discrepancy would be even greater if not for the salary cap.

**The stakes are higher.** Customers are more informed and empowered than ever.  You must deliver a great experience, or customers will flee - and tell their peers while they go.

* Bold prediction:  In 10 years, employees will receive personal IT budgets, and reserve seats to the software they believe they need to get their job done.  Further, they'll review their experience with each vendor in a system that's Yelp for B2B software.


###As work has changed, new challenges have emerged, and they'll become more pressing over time:

**I don't know how or when to get a hold of people.** Everywhere I work, I end up developing custom escalation paths for people I work with.  Some usually reply to email.  Some only reply to text or phone calls.  Some only respond when I walk over to their desk.  And for most people, it varies based on how busy they are in a particular day.
    
* Big Question:  How do I understand

**Accountability is low.** People respond to 12% of work emails.  You probably know a guy or gal in your company that just doesn't respond at all.  It's annoying, and it slows me down, but it doesn't impact their advancement.  So maybe it's surprising that even 12% are answered.  Further, the average response time is hours, not minutes.  With business moving in real time, slow is almost as bad as no response at all.  How do I get urgent customer issues resolved?
    
* Big Question:  With people working from everywhere, more email volume than ever, and new freelancers/contractors everyday, how do you maintain efficiency through growth?

**I don't have a track record.** If a restaurant serves one important customer well but nine others poorly, Yelp gives the nine a voice, and the restaurant will get dinged.  Too often in the workplace, anything your boss doesn't notice doesn't count.  Really, anything your boss doesn't remember doesn't count.  I'd like all my work that adds value to be captured, and I'd like to reflect the experience I have with all my coworkers.  
    
* Big Question:  How do we move beyond self-authored resume bullets to a real work track record?

**I don't feel connected to many of my coworkers.** With faster turnover, more locations, and changing work hours, it's harder than ever to build community at work.  When I don't know someone (or can't put a face to a name), it's hard to go the extra mile to help them.  That makes work less efficient.  

* Big Question:  How do you build company culture in a world of fast turnover and remote teams?

**It's really hard to retain great talent.** As companies grow, it becomes harder to keep being a “good company”.  Inefficiency, bureaucracy, and just plain BS creep in.  When they do, it becomes harder to serve customers effectively.  Both the organization and individual suffer, and it's all too easy for the individual to go find a better place to work.
    
* Big Question:  How do you make work so enjoyable that your best people ignore the daily recruitment emails they get from head hunters and competitors?


Sure, the challenges above are big.  But we believe the opportunity is even bigger.  Every employee has a computer in their pocket, and the technical know-how to use it.  The companies that will win are those that can empower these employees — and thus capitalize on the decentralized intelligence and decision-making power in their organizations. At Badge, we're building the mobile software to make this possible.  We're confident that will translate to great outcomes, for companies and employees alike.

What does it mean if we succeed?  Better companies and more happy employees.  That's what gets us up in the morning.
